Welcome to the Jewish Music Wiki. For now the only page is a short but growing list of Jewish songs inspired by other songs.

I'd like to expand it other resources, such as lists of different melodies of different zemiros and tefilos, and song lists for different times of the year or life cycle events.

Please feel free to contribute by clicking the edit button in the top right corner of the page (below the search bar)!
